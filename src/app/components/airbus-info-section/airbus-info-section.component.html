      <div>Like all members of Airbus’ family of modern jetliners, the A340-300 features a number of key innovations, including fly-by-wire flight controls, which bring increased flight protection as well as weight and cost savings; advanced weight-saving materials such as carbon fibre; and fuel-saving aerodynamics.  Commonality with Airbus’ family of fly-by-wire jetliners also brings important reductions in training and maintenance costs, providing customers with an important competitive advantage.

        Under the main deck, the A340’s large cargo holds provide voluminous capacity for extra revenue.  With large cargo doors standard, it can accommodate industry-standard LD3 containers in side-by-side loading.  The A340-300’s forward hold can hold six 96-inch pallets or 18 LD3 containers, while the aft hold accepts 14 LD3s or a mix of three 96-inch pallets and two 88-inch pallets. The A340-300 demonstrates outstanding environmental efficiencies, including low fuel-burn and reduced engine emissions, while the decreased noise signature comfortably meets international standards. The A340-300 provides the best economy in its class, reaching a 5 per cent lower fuel per trip compared to competing aircraft.</div>
